## About Lost Eclipse
Lost Eclipse (LE) is simply the pinnacle of all adventure mods. Built from the foundation up centered around a unique, expansive storyline, you will be doing more than just killing bosses and raiding dungeons. Alongside the storyline, Lost Eclipse brings in several new and innovative features, from custom weapon and item leveling systems, to unique, complex dungeons with randomized loot rewards. Essentially, our goal is to create an adventure journey like nothing ever seen before.

## Setting up a Workspace/Compiling from Source
Perhaps you are interested in getting the most up to date version of the mod possible, or are interested in modifying the mod to fit your own standards, here are some basic instructions for getting started.

* Setup: Download the source and run `gradlew [setupDecompWorkspace|setupDevWorkspace] [eclipse|idea]`
* Build: Download the source and run `gradlew build`

Distributing a customized version of Lost Eclipse publicly is forbidden. You may, however, use your customized version and share it with friends privately. You also may not distribute a compiled version of the mod yourself either. If you have any questions regarding this, just let me know.

## Downloads
Pre-Alpha versions of the mod will be uploaded seperate from CurseForge, and a link to those files will be found here when Pre-Alpha versions become readily available. Alpha versions and onwards will be hosted on CurseForge - which, when the time comes, will be linked here.

For now, Pre-Alpha builds are starting to make an appearance, though do to the lack of content as of now (and unstability of Forge 1.10), they will not be publicly available. However, they are not a long ways off.
