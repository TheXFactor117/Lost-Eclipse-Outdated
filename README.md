## About Lost Eclipse
Lost Eclipse (LE) is simply the pinnacle of all adventure mods. Built from the foundation up centered around a unique, expansive storyline, you will be doing more than just killing bosses and raiding dungeons. Alongside the storyline, Lost Eclipse brings in several new and innovative features, from custom weapon and item leveling systems, to unique, complex dungeons with randomized loot rewards. Essentially, our goal is to create an adventure journey like nothing ever seen before.
